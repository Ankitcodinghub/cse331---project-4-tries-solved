Assignment Overview

Tries consist of a root node with up to m child nodes, where each child node is either a leaf or the root of a subtrie. When used to store a vocabulary of English strings, we take m=26 and create 26 child nodes, each labeled with a letter a-z. To insert a string into our trie, we begin at the root node and go to its child labeled with the first letter in our word√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùthen, from this second node, we go to its child labeled with the second letter in the word‚Ä¶ and so on, until we reach the end of the string. At each step, we create children with the proper letter labels if they do not already exist. Lookups and deletions work similarly.

For a neat video introducing tries, follow this link!

The history of tries can be traced back to a 1959 paper by Rene De La Briandais of the U.S Naval Ordnance Lab published in the Proceedings of the Western Joint Computer Conference, and derive their name from the middle letters in reTRIEval thanks to Edward Fredkin.

In this project, you‚Äôll be implementing a trie and applying it to a machine learning-inspired application problem.

Assignment Specifications

Throughout, we refer to the set of words stored by a trie as its vocabulary.

We use n to refer to the number of unique words in a trie‚Äôs vocabulary, and use k to denote the length of a string.

class TrieNode:

DO NOT MODIFY the following attributes/functions

Attributes children: List of child TrieNodes.

is_end: Integer specifying the number of times the node is the end character of a word in a vocabulary. If is_end &gt; 0, then the word formed by traversing from the root node to the current node is a word in the vocabulary and was inserted into the trie a total of is_end times.

__init__(self, arr_size=26) arr_size: Number of children associated to the TrieNode. Defaults to 26 to store English strings, but could be modified to store strings of a different alphabet or set of symbols altogether.

Constructs a TrieNode with arr_size children, each initialized to None.

Time Complexity: O(1)

Space Complexity: O(arr_size)

__str__(self) and __repr__(self)

Returns a string representation of the trie rooted at this TrieNode.

Time Complexity: O(n^2)

Space Complexity: O(n^2)

__eq__(self, other)

Compares two TrieNodes for equality, including their children.

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)

IMPLEMENT the following functions empty(self)

Returns True if TrieNode is leaf (has no children).

Time Complexity: O(arr_size)

Space Complexity: O(1)

_get_index(char) (static) char: character to be mapped to integer

Returns the integer index of a character in a-z or A-Z. Should convert character to lowercase when determining its index such that lowercase and uppercase letters are mapped to the same index.

For example, _get_index(‚Äòb‚Äô) and _get_index(‚ÄòB‚Äô) should both return 1.

Used when trie is storing English strings (would not be applicable if trie is used to store other types of sequential data) Time Complexity: O(1)

Space Complexity: O(1) get_child(char) char: character of child TrieNode to retrieve

Retrieves and returns the child TrieNode at the index returned by _get_index(char) Time Complexity: O(1)

Space Complexity: O(1) set_child(char) char: character of child TrieNode to create

Creates TrieNode and stores it in children at the index returned by _get_index(char) Time Complexity: O(1)

Space Complexity: O(1) delete_child(char) char: character of child TrieNode to delete

Deletes the child TrieNode at the index returned by _get_index(char) by setting it to None

Time Complexity: O(1)

Space Complexity: O(1)

class Trie:

DO NOT MODIFY the following attributes/functions

Attributes root: TrieNode forming the root of the Trie.

unique: Integer counting the number of unique words in the vocabulary (i.e., the number of TrieNodes for which is_end &gt; 0). size: Integer counting the total number of words (including repetitions) in the vocabulary (i.e., the sum of the values of is_end for all TrieNodes in the trie). __init__(self)

Initializes the root node of the Trie and sets the size and unique attributes of the trie to 0. Time Complexity: O(1)

Space Complexity: O(1)

__str__(self) and __repr__(self)

Returns a string representation of the Trie.

Time Complexity: O(n^2)

Space Complexity: O(n^2)

__eq__(self, other)

Compares two Trie objects for equality by checking root nodes (and hence all child nodes) for equality. Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)

IMPLEMENT the following functions

add(self, word) word: String to be added to the Trie.

Adds word to Trie by traversing the Trie from the root downward using get_child() and creating TrieNodes as necessary using set_child().

If word does not exist in the Trie, increment unique.

Whether or not word already exists in the Trie, increment the is_end variable of the TrieNode corresponding to the last character of the word.

Whether or not word already exists in the Trie, increment size.

Returns the number of times word exists in the Trie; i.e., returns is_end of the TrieNode corresponding to the last character of the

MUST BE RECURSIVE and MUST CALL add_inner WITHOUT CHANGING SIGNATURE. add_inner(node, index):

node: Root node of subtrie to add word into. index: The integer index of the current character being traversed/added in word.

Example: if we are at the node corresponding to ‚Äúthe‚Äù in a call with word=‚Äùthere‚Äù, then index would be 2.

Adds child nodes using set_child() and recursively calls add_inner() as necessary until reaching the last character in the word, then increments is_end of the node corresponding to the last character of the word.

Time Complexity: O(k) Space Complexity: O(k)

word: String to be searched for in the Trie

Traverses the Trie from the root downward using get_child() until the last character of word is reached or a child node is None. Returns 0 if word is not found in Trie, else returns the number of times word exists in the Trie; i.e., returns is_end of the TrieNode corresponding to the last character of the word.

MUST BE RECURSIVE and MUST CALL search_inner WITHOUT CHANGING SIGNATURE. search_inner(node, index):

node: Root node of subtrie to search for word. index: The integer index of the current character being traversed in word.

Example: if we are at the node corresponding to ‚Äúthe‚Äù in a call with word=‚Äùthere‚Äù, then index would be 2.

Recursively calls search_inner() on the next character of word until finding that the word does or does not exist in the Trie and returns the number of occurrences of the word in the Trie. Time Complexity: O(k) Space Complexity: O(1)

word: String to be deleted from the Trie.

Traverses the Trie from the root downward using get_child() until the last character of word is reached or a child node is None. Deletes word from the Trie by setting the is_end variable of the TrieNode corresponding to the last character of the word to 0 and pruning the now-possibly-empty branch of the Trie in which word was stored.

Returns 0 if word is not found in Trie, else returns the number of times word existed in the Trie before deletion; i.e., returns is_end of the TrieNode corresponding to the last character of the word which was deleted.

Decrements unique and size appropriately if word is successfully deleted.

MUST BE RECURSIVE and MUST CALL delete_inner WITHOUT CHANGING SIGNATURE. delete_inner(node, index):

node: Root node of subtrie to delete word from. index: The integer index of the current character being traversed/added in word.

Example: if we are at the node corresponding to ‚Äúthe‚Äù in a call with word=‚Äùthere‚Äù, then index would be 2.

Traverses Trie until finding the node corresponding to the final character of word and determining whether or not word exists in the Trie.

Returns a (int, bool) tuple at each node indicating the number of copies of word removed and whether or not the current Node should be pruned from the tree.

Hint: if a Node has no children after a deletion and is not the end of a word, it should be pruned

Hint: returning a tuple from the inner function like this helps us maintain the structure of the Trie, but the client code only cares about the number of copies of word removed in the end√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùthis is why the return value of delete() is int but the return value of delete_inner() is a (int, bool).

Time Complexity: O(k)

Space Complexity: O(1)

__len__(self)

Returns the total number of words (including repetitions) in the vocabulary (i.e., the sum of the values of is_end for all TrieNodes in the trie).

Should simply return a member variable of Trie.

Time Complexity: O(1)

Space Complexity: O(1)

__contains__(self, word)

Returns True if word is stored in Trie, else False.

Should simply call another method of Trie and adjust the return value accordingly.

Time Complexity: O(k)

Space Complexity: O(1) empty(self)

Returns True if vocabulary of Trie is empty, else False.

Should simply check a member variable of Trie.

Time Complexity: O(1)

Space Complexity: O(1) get_vocabulary(self, prefix=‚Äù‚Äù) prefix: Prefix string to match with words in Trie.

Returns a dictionary of (word, count) pairs containing every word in the Trie beginning with prefix.

If prefix is an empty string, returns entire vocabulary as a dictionary of (word, count) pairs.

MUST BE RECURSIVE and MUST CALL get_vocabulary_inner WITHOUT CHANGING SIGNATURE.

Hint: declare a dictionary in the outer scope of your function and add items to it in each inner function call.

get_vocabulary_inner(node, suffix)

node: Root node of subtrie to add words from. suffix: The string of letters which must be appended to prefix to arrive to the current node.

Example: if we are at the node corresponding to ‚Äúthe‚Äù in a call with prefix=‚Äùt‚Äù, then suffix would be ‚Äúhe‚Äù such that

prefix + suffix = ‚Äúthe‚Äù

Adds the word prefix + suffix to an outer scope dictionary with value is_end if is_end &gt; 0.

Recursively calls get_vocabulary_inner on each of its children, appending the appropriate character to suffix in each recursive call.

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n) autocomplete(self, word) word: Template string to match with words in Trie.

Example: if the vocabulary of a Trie was {‚Äúthen‚Äù, ‚Äúthis‚Äù, ‚Äúthat‚Äù} with no duplicates then autocomplete(‚Äúth..‚Äù) would return a dictionary of {(word, 1)} pairs for every word in the Trie, while autocomplete(‚Äú‚Ä¶s‚Äù) would return {‚Äúthis‚Äù: 1} only.

If word consists of all periods (.), returns all words in vocabulary that are the same length as word as a dictionary of (word, count) pairs.

MUST BE RECURSIVE and MUST CALL autocomplete_inner WITHOUT CHANGING SIGNATURE.

Hint: declare a dictionary in the outer scope of your function and add items to it in each inner function call.

autocomplete_inner(node, prefix, index) node: Root node of subtrie to add words from. prefix: The string of letters used to arrive to the current node.

index: The integer index of the current character being searched in word

Example: if we are at the node corresponding to ‚Äúthe‚Äù in a call with word=‚Äùthe..‚Äù, then prefix would be ‚Äúthe‚Äù and index would be 2.

Adds the word prefix to an outer scope dictionary with value is_end if is_end &gt; 0.

Recursively calls autocomplete_inner on its child with character matching next letter of word if character is not period (.), else recursively calls autocomplete_inner on all children if character is period (.) to match all possible strings. Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

Application

Congratulations! You‚Äôve been hired by Twitter as a software engineer and placed on their analytics team. To better understand the dynamics of the platform during election season, your team‚Äôs been tasked with designing a classifier to classify tweets into one of c &gt;= 2 buckets, where each bucket corresponds to a topic, or class. Given a set of c possible classes and a set of labeled tweets (i.e., tweets known to belong to each class), your classifier needs to determine what words are most indicative of the class to which a tweet belongs√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùthen, given a set of unlabeled tweets, your classifier needs to predict the class to which each tweet belongs.

For example, your classifier might be used to conduct sentiment analysis, in which the goal is to predict whether a tweet has a positive or negative tone. Given a set of tweets that are considered to be positive and another set considered to be negative, your classifier will learn which words correspond to positive tweets and which correspond to negative tweets. Then, given a new tweet, your classifier will predict whether the tweet is positive or negative.

Of course, our world is not binary√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùnot every tweet can be partitioned into one of two classes. As such, your classifier will support classification into any integer c &gt;= 2 number of classes. For example, given a training set of tweets about sports, each relating to football, basketball, baseball, soccer, or hockey, (c = 5) your classifier will be able to predict whether a new tweet is about football, basketball, baseball, soccer, or hockey.

Because of the large volume of training and testing data you‚Äôll be working with, your team has decided to use tries to implement a classifier√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùthey allow extremely quick string searches while efficiently using space. Toward this end, you‚Äôve been asked to implement the TrieClassifier class, described below.

class TrieClassifier:

Throughout, we use c to refer to the number of classes and t to denote the number of training/testing strings (tweets) passed to the classifier.

DO NOT MODIFY the following attributes/functions

Attributes tries: A dictionary of c (class, Trie) pairs, where c is the number of classes such that each class maps to its own Trie.

__init__(self, classes) classes: A list of all c possible classes to which a string belongs.

Initializes the tries dictionary given a list of classes. Time Complexity: O(c)

Space Complexity: O(c) accuracy(labels, predictions) (static) labels: A list of strings corresponding to the true classes of a set of strings (tweets).

predictions: A list of strings corresponding to the predicted classes of a set of strings (tweets). Returns the proportion of predictions which match labels.

Time Complexity: O(t)

Space Complexity: O(1)

IMPLEMENT the following functions

fit(self, class_strings) class_strings: A dictionary of (class, List[str]) pairs to train the classifier on. Each string (tweet) in the list of strings associated to a class consists of multiple words.

Adds every individual word in the list of strings associated with each class to the Trie corresponding to the class in self.tries. Hint: make sure to split() each string in the list of strings associated to a class to ensure you add individual words to the trie, and not entire strings/tweets.

Time Complexity: O(t)

Space Complexity: O(t) predict(self, strings) strings: A list of strings (tweets) to be classified.

Returns a list of predicted classes corresponding to the input strings.

Predicts the class of a string (tweet) by:

Splitting the string into individual words

Creating a class score for each string (tweet) by:

Looking up how many times each word in the string was used in each class (hint: is_end within each class trie) Dividing this number by the total number of training words in each class (hint: len(trie) of each class trie) Why do we divide? To normalize for different-sized training sets!

Predicting the class as that with the maximum class score

Time Complexity: O(ct)

Space Complexity: O(ct)

Example

Suppose your classifier is to predict whether a tweet is ‚Äúpositive‚Äù or ‚Äúnegative‚Äù, and you are given the following positive and negative tweets to train your classifier upon:

train_positive = [‚Äúsun sunny sunshine‚Äù, ‚Äúsmile smiling smiled‚Äù,

‚Äúlaugh laughing laughed‚Äù, ‚Äúhappy happier happiest‚Äù] train_negative = [‚Äúrain rainy rained‚Äù, ‚Äúfrown frowning frowned‚Äù,

‚Äúcry crying cried‚Äù,

‚Äúsad sadder saddest‚Äù]

Then the self.tries dictionary will consist of

self.tries = {‚Äúpositive‚Äù: Trie, ‚Äúnegative‚Äù: Trie}

where each Trie has size 12 (remember, we split() training strings into individual words before adding them to each Trie). If we were to use our classifier to predict the classes of the strings

test = [‚Äúthe sunshine made me smile today‚Äù,

‚Äúlaughing with my best friends always makes me happier‚Äù,

‚Äúwhen youre happy you dont frown or cry‚Äù]

then our classifier would return the predictions

predictions = [‚Äúpositive‚Äù, ‚Äúpositive‚Äù, ‚Äúnegative‚Äù]

Why? ‚Äì The first string matches ‚Äúsunshine‚Äù and ‚Äúsmile‚Äù to achieve a positive score of 2/12, while achieving a negative score of 0 since no words match with the negative training set, so the first prediction is ‚Äúpositive‚Äù. ‚Äì The second string matches ‚Äúlaughing‚Äù and ‚Äúhappier‚Äù to again achieve a positive score of 2/12 and negative score of 0, so the second prediction is ‚Äúpositive‚Äù. ‚Äì The final string matches ‚Äúhappy‚Äù to achieve a positive score of 1/12 and matches ‚Äúfrown‚Äù and ‚Äúcry‚Äù to achieve a negative score of 2/12, so the final prediction is ‚Äúnegative‚Äù. If the labels of these sentences were

labels = [‚Äúpositive‚Äù, ‚Äúpositive‚Äù, ‚Äúpositive‚Äù] then a call to

self.accuracy(labels, predictions) would return 2/3, since the first two strings were correctly classified, while the final string was classified incorrectly.
